  <h1 class="page-title">RA Peer Review</h1>
  <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The purpose of peer review is two-fold: the obvious purpose is to give concrete, constructive feedback so that the writer can improve his or her paper. However, <strong>peer review is also meant to help you as the reviewer to better understand the requirements of the assignment and to improve your ability to spot issues within your own work</strong>. It’s often easier spot errors or ineffective passages in your draft after you’ve seen examples of them in others’ writing.</span>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <h3>Strategies for giving productive&nbsp;feedback:&nbsp;</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Skim the entire draft before you start</strong> to comment, to&nbsp;familiarize yourself with the writer’s ideas and style. &nbsp;Then, read it carefully and comment as you go.</span></li>
  </ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Be honest, yet tactful. &nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>W</strong></span><strong>rite more, rather than less.</strong></span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><strong>Prioritize higher-order (global) issues</strong>: &nbsp;argumentation, analysis, source integration, and organization. &nbsp;It's not your job to fuss about grammar/syntax unless there are so many errors that you really cannot understand what the writer is trying to say. &nbsp;Likewise, <span style="font-size: 12pt;">y</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ou're not obligated to comment on every single issue&nbsp;that you see. &nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="line-height: 24px;"><strong>Highlight specific passages</strong> using the peer review software to create marginal comments. &nbsp;</span>In your marginal comments:</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 24px;">Try to <strong>rephrase in your own words</strong> what you think the writer is trying to say. If you have trouble, that’s indication that there’s a problem with coherence and/or clarity.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Explain what you think the problem is</strong>. &nbsp;<strong><span class="instructure_file_link_holder link_holder"><span class="instructure_scribd_file_holder link_holder"><a class="" title="Way-RA+Midterm ePort Rubric.pdf" href="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/1937/files/560664/download?wrap=1" target="" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/api/v1/courses/1937/files/560664" data-api-returntype="File">Refer to the RA rubric</a></span></span></strong><span>&nbsp;as necessary.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span><strong>Ask questions</strong> if you're not sure what's going on in a passage or why the writer has made a particular choice. &nbsp;For example, "how does this relate to X in previous paragraph?" &nbsp;Questions are great for emphasizing your responses as a reader.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When you can, <strong>give specific suggestions</strong> for how the writer might revise (add, move, change, or delete).</span></span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Your general comment at the end should <strong>tie together&nbsp;major themes in the marginal notes </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;</strong>evaluate the essay as a whole.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Explain what you think the writer is doing well!&nbsp;</strong> Constructive criticism is as much about describing the positive as the negative.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Use the questions below to guide your comments on specific passages and aspects of the essay.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1) &nbsp;Describe the overall effectiveness of the introduction.</span></p>

<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Does the intro&nbsp;grab your attention with a perplexing question or relevant “hook” of some kind? &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Do you get a clear sense in the first paragraph of what the writer’s concerns are?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How well does the writer make a case for why this question and/or these concerns deserve our attention?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What suggestions do you have for how the writer could craft a more compelling introduction, rhetorically speaking?</span></li>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2) Describe the quality and complexity of the main argument/thesis statement.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Is there an arguable claim about rhetoric somewhere in the introduction (not necessarily in the first paragraph, may be more than one sentence).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Does this claim discuss&nbsp;genre conventions, audience and/or context of the chosen fairy tale?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How specific and compelling do you find this main thesis? &nbsp;Does it make you want to keep reading?</span></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How often does the writer discuss specific details/examples from their chosen fairy tale(s)? &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How relevant are these details/examples to the overall claims?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Does the writer follow up quotations, paraphrases and summaries with analytical commentary before moving on to the next detail or example?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How deeply and persuasively does the writer analyze the relationships between these details/examples?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Are you convinced by the writer's&nbsp;interpretations? How can the writer improve clarity and logic?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Are there any key details that seem to be missing from the discussion? What do you think the writer should consider adding to the analysis?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">4) Describe how well the writer has engaged and integrated secondary sources.</span></p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Does the writer introduce each source effectively in the essay, so that it’s easy to understand why she’s using it? &nbsp;Or do sources seem to serve little purpose? &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Does the writer use her secondary sources to&nbsp;<em>build</em>&nbsp;her claims? &nbsp;Does she demonstrate how the ideas are relevant to her&nbsp;main points?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Does the writer rely too much on his&nbsp;sources, so that his&nbsp;own ideas or voice are overshadowed?</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">5) Describe the organization of the essay.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Do you ever “get lost” when reading the paper? Is it always clear why Sentence B follows Sentence A, or why Paragraph D follows Paragraph C?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How effective are transitional devices (within and between paragraphs) in the essay?</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How objective is the writer’s attitude toward the problem? Whether the writer’s tone is objective or more subjective, is it a good fit for the subject of the essay? &nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Does the writer succeed in presenting herself as knowledgeable about her chosen fairy tale, its rhetorical situation and genre conventions?</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Do you ever find yourself bored or confused by the writer’s style? Are the sentence structures repetitive or wordy or otherwise confusing? How precise are the writer’s word choices?</span></li>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If applicable, what are the most important patterns of grammatical error that the writer should correct before submitting the final draft?</span></li>
